-- Introduction : 


            The Vehicle Management System (VMS) is a comprehensive web-based application that facilitates 
            the renting and selling of vehicles. It serves as a dynamic marketplace where users can 
            list their vehicles for rent or sale, and potential customers can browse and rent or purchase 
            these vehicles. The system is designed to streamline the process of vehicle management,
